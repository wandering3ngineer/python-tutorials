The python-tutorials project is basically a random assortment of some of my tutorials on python. These are tutorials I've placed on my blog at www.wandering3ngineer.com. The files for each tutorial is placed in seperate folders. These tutorials are basically my journey to re-learning python and upgrading my knowledge of front-end, back-end coding, app development, data science, etc.
