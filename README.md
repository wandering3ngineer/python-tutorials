The python-tutorials project is basically a random assortment of some of my tutorials on python. These are tutorials (some of which) I've placed on my blog at www.wandering3ngineer.com. The files for each tutorial are placed in seperate folders. Some of these I've used to provide short courses for students and colleagues

<H2>Power Data Extraction</H2>
Are you one of those paranoid people who is terrified that an insane calamity is just around the corner? Are you obsessively checking the world news waiting for the moment that you can spring into action? Well, why not harness that obsessiveness, be productive at the same time and check out if your country’s power system is about to come crashing down. Here I’ll show you a little bit of Python coding and analysis I did to discover some information about Taiwan’s Power Grid.

<H2>Weather Data Scraping</H2>
My goal is to try and do some data-scraping using google to grab some basic weather data. Though of-course this could also be applicable to any webpage and expanded quite easily beyond weather data. I’ll show two different approaches using a direct approach and another approach that controls a browser (via Selenium) to get access to the data after all dynamic HTML data has been rendered.

<H2>AI Voice Assistant</H2>
Want to make your own AI voice assistant. Grab this code and use google speech recognition, speech synthesis and openai to make your own simple voice assistant. Give it a go. And check out the video on youtube for a more detailed tutorial. Make sure you have your own API key for OpenAI - replace the existing key with your version. The key included is a dummy.

<H2>ChatGPT Clone</H2>
This code is demonstration code for a workshop done in the Summer of 2023 to teach professionals and tech students how to rapidly build and deploy (in 40 hours) their own LLM pre-trained model based voice chat system. The code provides all the foundations to build a microservice deployment of TTS, STT, LLM and API servcies on the backend and Flet / Flutter frontend. Deployment also require some docker container builds along with some shell scripts for testing and configuration. These are included
