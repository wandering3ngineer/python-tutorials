The python-tutorials project is basically a random assortment of some of my tutorials on python. These are tutorials I've placed on my blog at www.wandering3ngineer.com. The files for each tutorial is placed in seperate folders. These tutorials are basically my journey to re-learning python and upgrading my knowledge of front-end, back-end coding, app development, data science, etc. 

<H2>Power Data Extraction</H2>
Are you one of those paranoid people who is terrified that an insane calamity is just around the corner? Are you obsessively checking the world news waiting for the moment that you can spring into action? Well, why not harness that obsessiveness, be productive at the same time and check out if your country’s power system is about to come crashing down. Here I’ll show you a little bit of Python coding and analysis I did to discover some information about Taiwan’s Power Grid.

<H2>Weather Data Scraping</H2>
My goal is to try and do some data-scraping using google to grab some basic weather data. Though of-course this could also be applicable to any webpage and expanded quite easily beyond weather data. I’ll show two different approaches using a direct approach and another approach that controls a browser (via Selenium) to get access to the data after all dynamic HTML data has been rendered.
